Pie Recipe Page:
The second part is to recreate a specific web page of a recipe for lemon meringue pie, pie.html. Unlike index.html,
this page must exactly match the appearance specified in this document.
You must match in appearance the pie web page shown on the next page of this document. The width of the
screenshot below is based on a browser window width of 1024px; if your screen is a different size, the width of your
page may not exactly match. Any line breaks shown are done automatically by the browser, except ones that are
clearly much narrower than the page width, such as the line "One 9-inch pie":-->
<body>
    <a href="pie.html">Pie</a>
</body>
